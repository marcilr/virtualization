# hyper-v/      Microsoft Hyper-V, codenamed Viridian and formerly known as
#               Windows Server Virtualization, is a hypervisor-based
#               virtualization system for x86-64 systems.
#               http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-V
#
#               The issue with hyper-v is that it requires a separate windows
#               2008 or 2012 box to run vmm (Virtual Machine Manager) for p2v
#               of machines.  There is no nice "converter" app like VMware for
#               creation of machines.

#
# libvert/      libvirt is an open source API, daemon and management tool for
#               managing platform virtualization.[1] It can be used to manage
#               KVM, Xen, VMware ESX, QEMU and other virtualization
#               technologies.  These APIs are widely used in the orchestration
#               layer of hypervisors in the development of a cloud-based
#               solution.  
#               The most popular command line interface is 'virsh', and higher
#                level tools like oVirt.[8]

#               environments.  As a wrapper around common virtual machine
