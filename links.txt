  Reviews:
    "Being an open source software, it doesn't have fancy UI
    and most of the work / parameters are passed as a command
    line.  It could be very confusing for the first time users,
    specially ones without having prior command line experience.
    I have struggled myself quite a bit when I was introduced to
    Qemu."
