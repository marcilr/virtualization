Glossary for virtualization


P2V - Physical-to-Virtual ("P2V") describes the process of decoupling
  and migrating a physical server's operating system (OS), applications,
  and data from a physical server to a virtual machine guest hosted on
  a virtualized platform.

Virtualization - In computing, virtualization (or virtualisation) is the
  creation of a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, such
  as a hardware platform, operating system (OS), storage device, or
  network resources.[1]

VM - A virtual machine (VM) is a "completely isolated guest operating
  system installation within a normal host operating system".[1]
  Modern virtual machines are implemented with either software
  emulation or hardware virtualization.  In most cases, both are
  implemented together.

VPS - A virtual private server (VPS) is a virtual machine sold as a
  service by an Internet hosting service.

  A VPS runs its own copy of an operating system, and customers have
  superuser-level access to that operating system instance, so they can
  install almost any software that runs on that OS.  For many purposes they
  are functionally equivalent to a dedicated physical server, and being
  software-defined, are able to be much more easily created and configured.
  They are priced much lower than an equivalent physical server, but as they
  share the underlying physical hardware with other VPSs, performance may be
  lower, and may depend on the workload of other instances on the same
  hardware node.
